This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Ruby related to the use of `attr_accessor` without proper initialization in the class constructor. The bug showcases the difference between manually defining getter and setter methods versus using `attr_accessor`.  The `bug.rb` file contains code that exhibits the unexpected behavior, while `bugSolution.rb` provides a corrected version.
